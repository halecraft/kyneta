# @kyneta/exchange — Technical Reference

Substrate-agnostic state exchange for `@kyneta/schema`. Provides sync infrastructure for any substrate type through a unified three-message protocol dispatched by merge strategy.

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

The exchange operates at the boundary between three algebras defined by `@kyneta/schema`:

| Algebra | Domain | Currency |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Application** (CHANGEFEED) | Reactive UI, compiler regions | `Op`, `Changeset` |
| **State** (Substrate) | State management, merge semantics | Substrate-native |
| **Replication** (Exchange) | Peer-to-peer data transfer | `SubstratePayload`, `Version` |

The exchange is the active sync algebra. The substrate is the passive state algebra. They compose at the boundary defined by five substrate methods: `version()`, `exportSnapshot()`, `exportSince()`, `importDelta()`, and `context()`.

**Key invariant:** The exchange never inspects `SubstratePayload` contents. It treats payloads as opaque blobs with an encoding hint (`"json" | "binary"`). Only the substrate knows how to produce and consume them.

### The Elm Architecture (TEA)

The synchronizer follows TEA:

- **Model** (`SynchronizerModel`): immutable state — documents, channels, peers
- **Messages** (`SynchronizerMessage`): inputs — channel lifecycle, document lifecycle, received messages
- **Commands** (`Command`): outputs — side effects the runtime executes

The pure update function `(msg, model) → [model, cmd?]` contains all sync logic. The `Synchronizer` class is the imperative shell that dispatches messages, executes commands, and interacts with substrates.

```
Message → update(msg, model) → [newModel, Command?]
                                       ↓
                               Synchronizer.#executeCommand()
                                       ↓
                        ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
                        ↓              ↓              ↓
                   send message   import data    build offer
                   (via adapter)  (via substrate) (via substrate)
```

### Changefeed ↔ Synchronizer Wiring

The exchange bridges the Application algebra (CHANGEFEED) and the Replication algebra (Synchronizer) bidirectionally:

```
LOCAL MUTATION                              REMOTE MUTATION
─────────────                               ───────────────
change(doc, fn)                             adapter receives offer
  → wrappedFlush()                            → Synchronizer.#executeImportDocData()
    → originalFlush() [substrate committed]     → substrate.importDelta(payload, "sync")
    → deliverNotifications()                      → changefeed fires with origin: "sync"
      → Exchange's subscriber fires                 → UI subscribers see update
        → origin !== "sync" ✓
        → synchronizer.notifyLocalChange(docId)
          → TEA dispatch: local-doc-change
            → cmd/send-offer
              → adapter sends to peers
```

**Echo prevention:** Remote imports arrive through `importDelta(payload, "sync")`, which propagates `"sync"` as the origin through `executeBatch` → `wrappedFlush` → `deliverNotifications`. The Exchange's changefeed subscriber checks `changeset.origin === "sync"` and skips the `notifyLocalChange` call, preventing a feedback loop where received data would be re-broadcast.

**Timing:** The changefeed fires synchronously within `change()`. By the time the subscriber executes, `originalFlush` has already committed to the substrate, so `substrate.version()` reflects the new state — exactly what `notifyLocalChange` reads.

**`notifyLocalChange` remains public** for edge cases where the substrate is mutated directly via `unwrap(ref)` (bypassing the changefeed). For standard `change()` usage, it is called automatically.

---

## 2. Merge Strategy as Dispatch Key

Each `ExchangeSubstrateFactory<V>` declares a `MergeStrategy`:

```ts
type MergeStrategy =
  | { type: "causal" }      // bidirectional exchange, concurrent possible
  | { type: "sequential" }  // request/response, total order
  | { type: "lww" }         // unidirectional broadcast, timestamp-based
```

These are genuinely different protocols matched to the mathematical properties of the substrate, not transport optimizations:

| Property | Causal | Sequential | LWW |
|----------|--------|------------|-----|
| `compare()` results | `"concurrent"` possible | Never `"concurrent"` | Never `"concurrent"` |
| Sync direction | Bidirectional | Unidirectional per cycle | Unidirectional push |
| `exportSince()` used | Yes (primary) | Yes (when ahead) | Never |
| `exportSnapshot()` used | Fallback | Fallback or primary | Always |
| On local change | Push delta to synced peers | Push delta to synced peers | Broadcast snapshot to all peers |
| `interest.reciprocate` | `true` (bidirectional) | `false` | N/A (no interest needed after initial) |

### Protocol Shapes

**Causal (Loro):**
1. A sends `interest { docId, version, reciprocate: true }` to B
2. B sends `offer { docId, delta, version }` to A
3. B sends `interest { docId, version, reciprocate: false }` to A (reciprocation)
4. A sends `offer { docId, delta, version }` to B
5. Both converged via CRDT merge.

**Sequential (Plain):**
1. A sends `interest { docId, version }` to B
2. B compares versions → if ahead, sends `offer { docId, snapshot-or-delta, version }` to A
3. If B was behind, B would have sent its own interest.

**LWW (Ephemeral):**
1. On connection: both sides send `interest` (version may be absent)
2. Both respond with `offer { docId, snapshot, version: timestamp }`
3. On local change: broadcast `offer` to all peers (no interest needed)
4. Receiver compares timestamps and discards stale arrivals.

---

## 3. Three-Message Vocabulary

### `discover`

Document existence announcement. Sent after channel establishment to announce all known documents. The receiver sends `interest` messages for docs it also has.

```ts
type DiscoverMsg = {
  type: "discover"
  docIds: DocId[]
}
```

Future work: `docIds` may be replaced or augmented with query predicates (glob patterns, schema-based filters).

### `interest`

A declaration of sync interest. Carries the sender's current version (serialized string) so the receiver can compute a delta. For LWW substrates, `version` may be absent on initial connection.

```ts
type InterestMsg = {
  type: "interest"
  docId: DocId
  version?: string        // serialized Version, absent for LWW initial
  reciprocate?: boolean   // ask for bidirectional exchange (causal)
}
```

### `offer`

State transfer. Carries an opaque `SubstratePayload` and the sender's version.

```ts
type OfferMsg = {
  type: "offer"
  docId: DocId
  offerType: "snapshot" | "delta"
  payload: SubstratePayload
  version: string         // serialized Version of sender's state
  reciprocate?: boolean   // ask receiver to send interest back
}
```

The `offerType` field distinguishes snapshots from deltas:
- **`"snapshot"`**: full state — receiver reconstructs via `#importSnapshot()`
- **`"delta"`**: incremental — receiver applies via `substrate.importDelta()`

This distinction is necessary because `PlainSubstrate.importDelta()` expects Op[] format (path + change pairs), while `PlainSubstrate.exportSnapshot()` produces a JSON state image. For Loro substrates, `importDelta()` handles both formats natively.

### Establishment messages

Two additional messages handle channel handshake:

```ts
type EstablishRequestMsg = { type: "establish-request"; identity: PeerIdentityDetails }
type EstablishResponseMsg = { type: "establish-response"; identity: PeerIdentityDetails }
```

---

## 4. BoundSchema and Factory Builders

### The Three Choices

A `BoundSchema<S>` captures three explicit choices that define a document type:

1. **Schema** — what shape is the data? (a `SchemaNode` from `@kyneta/schema`)
2. **Factory builder** — how to construct the substrate? (a function `(ctx: { peerId }) => SubstrateFactory`)
3. **Merge strategy** — how does the exchange sync it? (`"causal"`, `"sequential"`, or `"lww"`)

```ts
interface BoundSchema<S extends SchemaNode = SchemaNode> {
  readonly _brand: "BoundSchema"
  readonly schema: S
  readonly factory: FactoryBuilder<any>
  readonly strategy: MergeStrategy
}

type FactoryBuilder<V extends Version> = (context: { peerId: string }) => SubstrateFactory<V>
type MergeStrategy = "causal" | "sequential" | "lww"
```

BoundSchemas are static declarations created at module scope via `bind()`, `bindPlain()`, `bindLww()`, or `bindLoro()`. They are consumed at runtime by `exchange.get(docId, boundSchema)`.

### Factory Builder Lifecycle

The factory is always a **builder function**, not a static instance. This solves the identity injection problem:

1. **`BoundSchema` is defined at module scope** — it's a static, shareable declaration.
2. **The exchange calls the builder lazily** on first `get()` that uses a given BoundSchema, passing `{ peerId: this.peerId }`.
3. **Each exchange gets a fresh factory** — two exchanges sharing the same BoundSchema produce independent factory instances with their own peer identity.
4. **Factories are cached per-exchange** — a `WeakMap<FactoryBuilder, SubstrateFactory>` ensures the builder is called at most once per exchange.

For Loro substrates, the builder hashes the string peerId to a deterministic numeric Loro PeerID and returns a factory that calls `doc.setPeerId()` on every new LoroDoc. For plain substrates, the builder ignores the context: `() => plainSubstrateFactory`.

### Convenience Wrappers

| Function | Package | Factory | Strategy |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| `bindPlain(schema)` | `@kyneta/schema` | `() => plainSubstrateFactory` | `"sequential"` |
| `bindLww(schema)` | `@kyneta/schema` | `() => plainSubstrateFactory` | `"lww"` |
| `bindLoro(schema)` | `@kyneta/loro-schema` | `(ctx) => createLoroFactory(ctx.peerId)` | `"causal"` |

### Why Not `ExchangeSubstrateFactory`?

The previous design used `ExchangeSubstrateFactory` — a `SubstrateFactory` extended with `mergeStrategy` and `_initialize()`. This was replaced by `BoundSchema` because:

1. **Merge strategy was on the wrong entity.** The same `plainSubstrateFactory` can be used with `"sequential"` or `"lww"`. The strategy is a property of *how the exchange uses the factory*, not the factory itself.
2. **`_initialize()` didn't compose.** If a factory was shared across exchanges, it would be initialized with the first exchange's peerId. The builder function pattern produces a fresh factory per exchange.
3. **Boilerplate.** Every usage required wrapping a `SubstrateFactory` to add `mergeStrategy` and `_initialize` — ~10 lines of wrapping per factory.

### Escape Hatches

Two escape hatches provide access to the underlying substrate:

- **`unwrap(ref)`** in `@kyneta/schema` — general, returns `Substrate<any>`. Uses a `WeakMap<object, Substrate>` populated by `registerSubstrate()` (called by the exchange after building the ref).
- **`loro(ref)`** in `@kyneta/loro-schema` — Loro-specific, returns `LoroDoc`. Uses `unwrap()` internally to get the substrate, then a `WeakMap<Substrate, LoroDoc>` populated by `createLoroSubstrate()`.

The two-step approach (ref → substrate → LoroDoc) avoids duplicating tracking WeakMaps and composes cleanly. Currently supports root-level refs only; child-level resolution (e.g. `loro(doc.title)` → `LoroText`) is future work.

---

## 5. Channel and Adapter Abstraction

### Channel Lifecycle

```
GeneratedChannel → ConnectedChannel → EstablishedChannel
     (adapter)       (synchronizer)      (after handshake)
```

- **GeneratedChannel**: created by `Adapter.generate()`. Has `send`, `stop`, `kind`, `adapterType`.
- **ConnectedChannel**: registered with the synchronizer. Has `channelId`, `onReceive`.
- **EstablishedChannel**: completed the establish handshake. Has `peerId` of the remote peer.

### Adapter Base Class

Adapters follow a lifecycle managed by the `AdapterManager`:

1. **`_initialize(context)`**: receives identity and callbacks (onChannelAdded, onChannelRemoved, onChannelReceive, onChannelEstablish)
2. **`_start()`**: begins operation — subclasses create initial channels here
3. **`_stop()`**: cleans up — all channels are removed

Subclasses implement `generate(context)`, `onStart()`, and `onStop()`.

### BridgeAdapter

In-process adapter for testing. Messages are delivered asynchronously via `queueMicrotask()` to simulate real network behavior. Two-phase initialization avoids double-establishment:

1. **Phase 1**: Create channels to all existing peers (no establishment)
2. **Phase 2**: Only the joining adapter initiates establishment

---

## 6. TimestampVersion

`TimestampVersion` implements `Version` using wall-clock timestamps (milliseconds since epoch) for LWW semantics.

```ts
class TimestampVersion implements Version {
  readonly timestamp: number
  serialize(): string           // decimal string
  compare(other): "behind" | "equal" | "ahead"  // never "concurrent"
  static now(): TimestampVersion
  static parse(s: string): TimestampVersion
}
```

The LWW algorithm depends on honest, time-synchronized senders. The timestamp serves dual purpose:
1. **Out-of-order filtering**: receiver discards arrivals with older timestamps
2. **Compare-once semantics**: no coordination needed — just compare timestamps at destination

### Version on the History Spectrum

Three Version implementations span the full spectrum from causal history to pure present:

| Version Type | Substrate | Order | History |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LoroVersion` (VersionVector) | Loro CRDT | Partial | Full causal oplog |
| `PlainVersion` (monotonic counter) | Plain JS | Total (single-writer) | Limited op log |
| `TimestampVersion` (wall clock) | LWW/Ephemeral | Total (by convention) | None — latest value only |

---

## 7. Snapshot Import Strategy

When the exchange receives an `offer` with `offerType: "snapshot"`, it must reconstruct the state in the existing substrate without replacing the ref objects (which the application holds references to).

### Strategy 1: Try `importDelta`

For substrates whose `importDelta()` accepts snapshot payloads (e.g. Loro, where `doc.import()` handles both snapshots and updates), this works directly.

### Strategy 2: Replay as ReplaceChange ops

If `importDelta()` fails (e.g. PlainSubstrate, which expects Op[] format):

1. Construct a temporary substrate via `factory.fromSnapshot(payload, schema)`
2. Export its snapshot to get the JSON state image
3. Parse the state and build one `ReplaceChange` per top-level key
4. Replay through `executeBatch(ctx, ops, "sync")` on the existing substrate

This preserves all ref identities — the interpreter stack, caches, and changefeed subscriptions remain intact.

### Empty Delta Detection

When two peers have the same version counter but different content (e.g. one was seeded, one wasn't), `exportSince()` returns an empty delta. The exchange detects this and falls back to snapshot:

```
exportSince(peer_version) → empty delta?
  → yes: fall back to exportSnapshot()
  → no: send the delta
```

This handles the common case where `PlainSubstrate.create(schema, seed)` writes seed values directly to the store without going through `prepare/flush`, so the version remains `0` but the state is non-empty.

---

## 8. LWW Substrate Pattern

An LWW substrate wraps a `PlainSubstrate` with `TimestampVersion`:

- **State management**: delegates to the inner `PlainSubstrate` (same `StoreReader`, `applyChangeToStore`, interpreter stack)
- **Version tracking**: `TimestampVersion` bumped on every `onFlush()` and `importDelta()`
- **Export**: always `exportSnapshot()` (full state)
- **Import**: delegates to inner `PlainSubstrate`

**Critical:** The LWW substrate must override `context()` to return a `WritableContext` built from the **wrapper** substrate, not the inner one. This ensures `onFlush()` (which bumps the timestamp version) is called during `change()`:

```ts
context(): WritableContext {
  if (!cachedCtx) {
    cachedCtx = buildWritableContext(wrapperSubstrate)  // NOT inner
  }
  return cachedCtx
}
```

If `context()` delegates to `inner.context()`, the inner plain substrate's `onFlush` runs but the wrapper's version is never bumped, causing LWW timestamp comparison to use stale timestamps.

---

## 9. Serialized Dispatch with Quiescence Flush

The `Synchronizer` processes messages one at a time via a serialized dispatch loop:

```
#dispatch(msg):
  pendingMessages.push(msg)
  if already dispatching: return

  dispatching = true
  while pendingMessages.length > 0:
    msg = pendingMessages.shift()
    [newModel, cmd] = updateFn(msg, model)
    model = newModel
    if cmd: executeCommand(cmd)     // may push more messages

  // Quiescence — all messages processed
  flushOutbound()                   // send accumulated envelopes
  emitReadyStateChanges()           // notify listeners
  dispatching = false
```

Commands that produce new messages (e.g. `cmd/dispatch`) are pushed to `pendingMessages` and processed in the same dispatch cycle. Outbound messages are accumulated in a queue and flushed only at quiescence, ensuring consistent model state before any messages leave the exchange.

## 11. Wire Format (`@kyneta/wire`)

The `@kyneta/wire` package provides serialization infrastructure for the exchange's 5-message protocol. It sits between the exchange and network adapters in the dependency graph:

```
@kyneta/exchange  →  @kyneta/wire  →  @kyneta/websocket-network-adapter
   (messages)         (codecs)          (network adapter)
                                        @kyneta/sse-network-adapter (future)
```

### Frame<T> — Universal Abstraction

Every message is wrapped in a `Frame<T>`. A frame carries a protocol version, an optional content hash (reserved for future SHA-256), and content that is either **complete** (the full payload) or a **fragment** (one piece of a larger payload). Binary pipeline: `Frame<Uint8Array>`. Text pipeline: `Frame<string>`.

Batching is **orthogonal to framing**. The frame layer does not distinguish single messages from batches — the payload's own structure (CBOR array vs map, JSON array vs object) determines singular vs plural.

### Two Codec Interfaces

| Interface | Type `T` | Implementation | Transport | Binary Payload |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **BinaryCodec** | `Uint8Array` | `cborCodec` | WebSocket, WebRTC | Native CBOR byte strings |
| **TextCodec** | JSON-safe objects | `textCodec` | SSE, HTTP | Base64-encoded in JSON |

The `BinaryCodec` operates on raw bytes (`encode`/`decode`/`encodeBatch`/`decodeBatch` with `Uint8Array`). The `TextCodec` operates on JSON-safe objects (`encode` returns `unknown`, `decode` accepts `unknown`).

### Two Pipelines

```
Binary: BinaryCodec (CBOR) → binary frame (7B header) → binary fragmentation → FragmentReassembler
                                                                                 └→ FragmentCollector<Uint8Array>

Text:   TextCodec (JSON)   → text frame ("Vx" prefix) → text fragmentation   → TextReassembler
                                                                                 └→ FragmentCollector<string>
```

### Binary Frame Format

7-byte header: version (1B, `0x00`) + type (1B, `0x00`=complete / `0x01`=fragment) + hash algorithm (1B, `0x00`=none) + payload length (4B BE). Fragment frames add 20 bytes of metadata (frameId 8B + index 4B + total 4B + totalSize 4B) before the payload. Two transport prefixes: `0x00` (complete) and `0x01` (fragment).

### Text Frame Format

JSON array with a 2-character prefix: position 0 is the version (`'0'`), position 1 encodes type + hash via case (`'c'`=complete, `'C'`=complete+hash, `'f'`=fragment, `'F'`=fragment+hash). Complete frames embed the payload as a native JSON value. Fragment frames carry `frameId`, `index`, `total`, `totalSize`, and a JSON substring chunk.

### FragmentCollector<T>

Generic stateful fragment collector parameterized on chunk type `T`. Uses a pure decision function (`decideFragment`) as the functional core and the `FragmentCollector` class as the imperative shell. Both `FragmentReassembler` (binary) and `TextReassembler` (text) are thin wrappers (~80–100 lines) that handle format-specific parsing and delegate collection to the generic collector.

Fragments are fully self-describing — no separate "fragment header" message. The collector auto-creates tracking state on first contact with a new frame ID. Configurable timeouts (default 10s), max concurrent frames (32), max total size (50MB), and oldest-first eviction.

### Wire Type Discriminators (CBOR)

| Message | Discriminator | Compact Fields |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| `establish-request` | `0x01` | `t`, `id`, `n?`, `y` |
| `establish-response` | `0x02` | `t`, `id`, `n?`, `y` |
| `discover` | `0x10` | `t`, `docs` |
| `interest` | `0x11` | `t`, `doc`, `v?`, `r?` |
| `offer` | `0x12` | `t`, `doc`, `ot`, `pe`, `d`, `v`, `r?` |

See `packages/exchange/wire/PROTOCOL.md` for the full wire protocol specification.

## 12. Websocket Network Adapter (`@kyneta/websocket-network-adapter`)

The first real network adapter. Framework-agnostic via the `Socket` interface, with platform-specific wrappers for browser, Node.js `ws`, and Bun.

### Package Structure

Three subpath exports (no combined `"."` entry) to keep client/server/bun code tree-shakeable:

| Subpath | Entry | Key Exports |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `./client` | `src/client.ts` | `WebsocketClientAdapter`, `createWebsocketClient`, `createServiceWebsocketClient`, `WebsocketClientStateMachine` |
| `./server` | `src/server.ts` | `WebsocketServerAdapter`, `WebsocketConnection`, `wrapNodeWebsocket`, `wrapStandardWebsocket` |
| `./bun` | `src/bun.ts` | `BunWebsocketData`, `wrapBunWebsocket`, `createBunWebsocketHandlers` |

### Connection Handshake

The Websocket connection handshake is two-phase to avoid race conditions:

1. **Transport-level**: Server sends text `"ready"` signal after Websocket opens
2. **Protocol-level**: Client creates channel + sends `establish-request` after receiving `"ready"`
3. Server's Synchronizer processes the `establish-request` and responds with `establish-response`

The server does NOT call `establishChannel()` — it waits for the client's establish-request. This prevents a race condition where the server's binary establish-request could arrive before the client has processed `"ready"` and created its channel.

### Client State Machine

The `WebsocketClientStateMachine` provides validated, observable state transitions:

```
disconnected → connecting → connected → ready
                   ↓            ↓         ↓
              reconnecting ← ─ ┴ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘
```

Transitions are delivered asynchronously via microtask queue. Reconnection uses exponential backoff with jitter.

### Integration Tests

End-to-end tests in `tests/exchange-websocket/` prove the full stack over real Websocket connections for all three merge strategies (sequential, causal, LWW), heterogeneous documents, and large payload fragmentation. These use Bun's built-in Websocket server on random ports.

## 13. Verified Properties

1. **Sequential sync converges**: Two exchanges with `bindPlain()`, peer A creates doc with seed, peer B syncs and reads same state. Mutations from A propagate to B after initial sync.

2. **Causal sync converges**: Two exchanges with `bindLoro()`, concurrent edits from both peers produce identical final state on both sides (CRDT merge).

3. **LWW broadcast works**: Peer A sets presence via `change()`, peer B receives snapshot via LWW broadcast, state matches. Updates propagate via subsequent broadcasts.

4. **Heterogeneous documents**: Single exchange hosts both Loro-backed (`bindLoro`) and plain-backed (`bindPlain`) documents. Both sync correctly to a peer through the same adapter infrastructure.

5. **Factory builder isolation**: Two exchanges sharing the same `BoundSchema` get independent factory instances, each with the correct peer identity.

6. **Escape hatches work**: `unwrap(ref)` returns the substrate; `loro(ref)` returns the LoroDoc. Both compose via the `WeakMap` chain (ref → substrate → LoroDoc).

7. **Existing tests unaffected**: `@kyneta/schema` tests (1110) and `@kyneta/loro-schema` tests (92) pass, including new `bind`/`unwrap`/`bindLoro`/`loro` tests. The `SubstrateFactory`, `Substrate`, and `Version` interfaces are unchanged.

8. **Wire codec round-trip**: All 5 message types survive encode → decode through both CBOR and JSON codecs, including `OfferMsg` with binary `SubstratePayload` (38 codec tests, 31 frame tests, 54 fragment tests).

9. **Websocket transport sync**: Sequential, causal, and LWW sync all work over real Websocket connections (Bun server + client adapter). Heterogeneous documents and fragmented large payloads sync correctly (8 integration tests).

10. **Local mutations auto-trigger sync**: `change(doc, fn)` automatically notifies the synchronizer via the changefeed → `notifyLocalChange` wiring. No manual `synchronizer.notifyLocalChange()` call is needed. Echo is prevented by filtering `origin === "sync"` in the changefeed subscriber.

11. **End-to-end in a real app**: The `examples/todo/` app proves the full managed sync path in a running application: `LoroSchema` → `bindLoro` → `Exchange` → `WebsocketServerAdapter`/`WebsocketClientAdapter` → Cast compiled view → collaborative real-time sync between browser tabs. No hand-rolled WebSocket code — `change(doc, fn)` on any client automatically propagates to all peers via the changefeed → synchronizer → adapter pipeline.

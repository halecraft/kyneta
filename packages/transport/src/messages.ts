// messages — substrate-agnostic message types for the sync protocol.
//
// Five sync messages form the document-exchange vocabulary:
// - `present` — "I have these documents, here are their properties."
// - `interest` — "I want document X. Here's my version."
// - `offer` — "Here is state for document X."
// - `dismiss` — "I'm leaving the sync graph for this document."
// - `vacant` — "You want document X, but I don't have it and won't serve it."
//
// Two lifecycle messages manage channel presence:
// - `establish` — symmetric handshake; both peers send on connect
// - `depart` — intentional departure; peer is leaving the channel
//
// These are uniform across all sync protocols. The sync algorithm
// determines *when* and *how* they are sent, not their shape.
